The management committees are responsible for oversight and monitoring of the key risks facing the Firm. The ‘3rd line of defence’ is ultimately performed by the Board supported by the other Brevan Howard group management committees including BHCM’s Audit Committee.

BHCM’s Audit Committee is composed of non-executive members and meets on a quarterly basis.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Board is responsible for determining the risk appetite for the Firm.

Results and findings of audit reviews are presented to BHCM’s Audit Committee and, where, appropriate, to any other committees or management boards including for example the Board.<br />\r\n"

Instead, the Board sets and oversees compliance with the Firm’s remuneration policy, including reviewing the terms of the policy on at least an annual basis.</p>\n<p>The Firm currently sets the variable remuneration of its staff in a manner which takes into account individual performance, performance of the individual’s business unit and the overall results of the Firm. As permitted for firms falling within proportionality level 3, the Firm takes into account the specific nature of its own activities (including the fee-based nature of its revenues) in conducting any ex-ante risk adjustments to awards of variable remuneration and, given the nature of its business, has dis-applied the requirement under the BIPRU Remuneration Code to make ex-post risk adjustments.</p>\n<p>The Firm only has one “business area”, which is its investment management business.

Brevan Howard Asset Management LLP (\"BHAM\" or the \"Firm\") or its affiliates (collectively \"Brevan Howard\") do not currently have a formal policy and process for considering such adverse impacts, although periodically may do so at their discretion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSFDR regulation applies to all financial market participants and financial advisors in the EU, with EU shareholders and those marketing in the EU, setting out clear disclosure requirements when it comes to ESG considerations. Since March 2021, SFDR requires that UCITS and AIFMs must designate investment products as an Article 6, 8 or 9 fund, and make certain disclosures in keeping with this choice. These pre-contractual disclosures are required to ensure that investors have greater transparency before entering an investment product or accepting advice. These are customarily outlined in a funds’ Prospectus or Offering Document.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBrevan Howard manages or advises Article 6 funds, meaning they are funds that neither have a sustainable investment objective, nor do they embrace investment in assets with environmental or social benefits. This is primarily based on the assessment the Firms’ current trading strategies, however will be reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure the correct categorisation is made.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor Article 6 products, there is a requirement to publish a Principle Adverse Impact (PAI) statement or explain the choice not to. As the Firm employs fewer than 500 staff, there is no requirement to publish a PAI."
