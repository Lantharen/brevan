Crypto currency exchanges generally purchase crypto currencies for their own account on the public ledger and allocate positions to customers through internal bookkeeping entries while maintaining exclusive control of the private keys. Under this structure, crypto currency exchanges collect large amounts of customer funds for the purpose of buying and holding virtual currencies on behalf of their customers. The opaque underlying spot market and lack of regulatory oversight potentially creates a risk that a crypto currency exchange may not hold sufficient crypto currencies and funds to satisfy its obligations and that such deficiency may not be easily identified or discovered. Many digital asset exchanges have experienced significant outages, downtime and transaction processing delays and may have a higher level of operational risk than regulated futures or securities exchanges.",
